# MusicGenerationInErlang
Computer music generation software like Sonic Pi provide people with a complete and creative sound and music computing system. But it is often difficult for general users, such as real musicians and beginner programmers to learn and use. In this dissertation, we have designed and implemented a music generation library in Erlang to address this problem. With this library, users can write their own music files in our library language and then play the music with Sonic Pi server. Our library is convenient, efficient and simple compared with Sonic Pi language. We also developed a music genetic algorithm to allow automatic algorithmic composition. The algorithm can evolve the melody given the input parameters of scale type, key, scale root, number of tracks, instruments etc. The last generation of melodies would be saved as music files in our library language, which then can be used to play using our library. Within enough generations, our algorithm can produce melodic and beautiful melodies for the user.
